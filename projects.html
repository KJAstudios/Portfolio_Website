    <h1>here's some various projects I've done in my free time</h1>
    <h2>Guild Wars 2 Companion App</h2>
    <p>I started programming this during the downtime I had due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I thought building an API app
        for a game I thorougly enjoy would be a good learning experience for my future.
