        I worked on this game as the main optimization programmer. My responsibilities primarily involved
        programming the game systems that would allow for the game to run in an open world, such as LOD, occlusion culling,
        and similar concepts. I am also responsible for general code inspection, cleaning up slower bits of code to help the
        game run faster. You can view the game on Steam 
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1409350/Brushlings_Pale_Moon/">here.</a>
